# Events Management⚙️
This project was developed during EPICODE Backend's class

The exercise requests the creation of a web application that allows users to  view a list of events, booking seats to attend at available events and provide management functionality of events for organizers.

- Implement a registration and access system for users. There are two types of users: ADMIN (organizers) and normal users. Passwords must be properly protected.
- Organizers can create new events by specifying details like title, description, date, place and available number of seats.
- Normal users can reserve seats to participate at the events that still have availability.
- Properly manage  exceptions and appropriate error responses.
